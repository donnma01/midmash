Electric Car Local Energy Mix
Creators: James Miller and Mason Donnohue

The big issues with this program relate to the API key limits from developer.edmunds.com , which only allows 25 API calls per day per key.
(one entry of a car, however, costs 2 calls). We have created 3 separate accounts to obtain 3 different keys, and we have created an array of the keys in carserver.py (our proxy)
so that the maximum number of calls can be 75 per day (roughly 35 uses of the program per day). 

If you have any issues, please let us know. They are likely caused by this key problem, which only we can handle.

Thanks,
Mason and James
